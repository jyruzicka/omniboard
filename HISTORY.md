# 0.4.0 // 2016-06-27

Updates galore! Well, some updates, anyway. While there are some larger underlying problems with the codebase, I've just been focussing on the notes of each project.

* [New] Project notes will now show basic styling (italics, bold, underline; better paragraphs).
* [New] Added some shiny CSS for the project details - notes and remaining tasks lists should be a bit sexier
* [New] Projects now show due and deferral dates (when appropriate) in the project overlay

# 0.3.3 // 2016-05-23

Wow, it's been some time, hasn't it? Let's add updates to this.

* [New] Omniboard works out when your document is out of date, or even when it's become detached from the head of your omnifocus database, and lets you know.
* [Fix] `Group` now has a default `light_colour` method - no more errors if you don't group your projects!


# 0.3.1 // 2016-02-13

* [Fix] Remove console.log() debugging in js functions
* [Fix] Previous change to hide/show code resulted in a non-functioning info overlay. Now fixed.

# 0.3.0 // 2016-02-12

* [New] You can now set a block property to `nil` to avoid running any block (including any defaults).

# 0.2.1 // 2016-02-09

* [Fix] Added `trollop` to list of runtime dependencies

# 0.2.0 // 2016-02-08

A number of updates around the board

* [New] Project groups will hide themselves if every child project has been hidden.
* [New] Added `Column#filter_button`, which allows you to add a button filtering out dimmed tasks.

# 0.1.0 // 2016-02-04
